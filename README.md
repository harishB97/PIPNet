# HComP-Net: Hierarchy aligned Commonality through Prototypical Networks
This repository presents the PyTorch code for **HComP-Net** (**H**ierarchy aligned **Com**monality through **P**rototypical **Net**works) 

[Project Page](https://imageomics.github.io/HComPNet/)

**HComP-Net** is an hierarchical interpretable image classification framework that can be applied to discover potential evolutionary traits from images by making use of the Phylogenetic tree also called as Tree-Of-Life. HComPNet generates hypothesis for potential evolutionary traits by learning semantically meaningful non-over-specific prototypes at each internal node of the hierarchy.

**Paper: What Do You See in Common? Learning Hierarchical Prototypes over Tree-of-Life to Discover Evolutionary Traits**

> ***Abstract:*** 
>> *A grand challenge in biology is to discover evolutionary traits, which are features of organisms common to a group of species with a shared ancestor in the Tree of Life (also referred to as phylogenetic tree). With the growing availability of large-scale image repositories in biology and recent advances in the field of explainable ML such as ProtoPNet and other prototype-based methods, there is a tremendous opportunity to discover evolutionary traits directly from images in the form of a hierarchy of prototypes learned at internal nodes of the phylogenetic tree. However, current prototype-based methods are mostly designed to operate over a flat structure of classes and face several challenges in discovering hierarchical prototypes on a tree, including the problem of learning over-specific features at internal nodes in the tree. To overcome these challenges, we introduce the framework of **H**ierarchy aligned **Com**monality through **P**rototypical **Net**works (**HComP-Net**), which learns common features shared by all descendant species of an internal node and avoids the learning of over-specific prototypes. We empirically show that HComP-Net learns prototypes that are accurate and semantically consistent in comparison to baselines on 190 species of birds from the CUB-200-2011 dataset. We also show the ability of HComP-Net to generate novel hypotheses about evolutionary traits discovered for butterflies and fishes. While we focus on the biological problem of discovering evolutionary traits, our work can be applied to any domain involving a hierarchy of classes.*

## Setting up environment
Run the following command to create and activate a new conda environment
```
conda create -n hcomp
conda activate hcomp
```
and run the following command to install the required packages
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setting up datasets

#### CUB-190

Download CUB-200-2011 [1] dataset and save it in the ```/data``` path

Once downloaded the folder structure should look something like this  
```
data/
└── CUB_200_2011/
    ├── attributes/ # Not used
    ├── images/
    ├── parts/ 
    ├── image_class_labels.txt
    ├── train_test_split.txt
    ├── images.txt
    ├── bounding_boxes.txt
    ├── classes.txt
    └── README.md
```

Run the following command to create ```CUB-190``` dataset. Running the command creates ```dataset_cub190``` and ```images_cub190``` folders

```
python preprocess_data/prepare_cub190.py --segment
```

The folder structure should now look like this  
```
data/
└── CUB_200_2011/
    ├── attributes/ # Not used
    ├── dataset_cub190/ # Newly created
    ├── images/
    ├── images_cub190/ # Newly created
    ├── parts/ 
    ├── image_class_labels.txt
    ├── train_test_split.txt
    ├── images.txt
    ├── bounding_boxes.txt
    ├── classes.txt
    └── README.md
```

## Training HComP-Net
In order to train the model run the following command.
The following command is for running the model on ```cub190``` dataset. Running ```cub190``` with a ```batch_size``` of 256 required two a100 GPUs, therefore ```gpu_ids``` is set to ```0,1```. For running on single gpu remove the ```gpu_ids``` argument, as it assume single GPU by default.
```
python main.py --log_dir './runs/hcompnet_cub190_cnext26' --dataset CUB-190 --net convnext_tiny_26 --batch_size 256 --batch_size_pretrain 256 --epochs 75 --epochs_pretrain 10 --epochs_finetune_classifier 3 --epochs_finetune_mask 60 --freeze_epochs 10 --gpu_ids '0,1' --num_workers 8 --phylo_config ./configs/cub190_phylogeny.yaml --num_protos_per_child 10
```

## Visualizing the prototypes

We create Top-K Visualizations to analyze prototypes, where we visualize the Top-K nearest image patches for an hierarchical prototype from each leaf descendant. Follow the steps in the ```plot_topk_visualizations.ipynb```, to create Top-K visualization.

## Analyzing the semantic quality of prototypes

Follow instructions in ```part_purity_cub.ipynb``` to quantitatively analyze the semantic quality of prototypes
